<ul>
    <li>
        The constructor sets up the subscription, but the observable itself will continue emitting values over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Observables are asynchronous and can emit multiple values (or even no value), so the this.exclusive will update
        whenever a new value is emitted from the exclusive observable.
    </li>
    <li>
        The subscription is active as long as the component exists, and Angular will automatically clean it up when the
        component is destroyed, assuming you properly manage unsubscriptions (more on that below).
    </li>
    <li>
        Observables are not one-time values; they can emit multiple values over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        So, while the constructor runs only once, the subscription continues to listen for updates whenever the
        exclusive observable emits a new value.
    </li>
